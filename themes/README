Each folder represents an individual theme.

Theme structure:
<theme-name>/
    style.css   - additional styling
    templates/  - custom template htmls
    ...         - custom template files such as images or fonts

Please use the latest HTML files[1] as a starting point, and avoid excessive overriding.
